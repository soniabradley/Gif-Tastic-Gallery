# Gif-Tastic Gallery

Gif-Tastic Gallery creates a dynamic web page that populates with gifs by searching the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/) based on key words selected by the user. Users may click on images to play/pause the gifs. Each search is limited to 10 gifs and each search is prepended.

See [Gif-Tastic Gallery](https://soniabradley.github.io/Gif-Tastic-Gallery/) on Github Pages for a live demo.
